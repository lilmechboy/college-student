## This is a program that tracks students and their progress

### Description

Greetings, this is a program that was started as a final project for Promineo Tech, 
tying together info for students, their courses, and their grades. I want to find a
way to turn the data into a visual showcase to show the impact that student
organizations can have on their members.
You can contribute more code written in Java

### On the Docket

My next steps are 
1. Work out the foreign key addition for grades
2. Adding student clubs
3. Adding student organization
4. Timestamps/Dates to be able to show student progression
5. Learning some more front end to be able to showcase the data in a visual way 
6. There is potential for adding different schools too
7. Equivalency chart for courses from other schools (long-term)
